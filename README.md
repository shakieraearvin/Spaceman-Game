 ## ðŸŽ® Game Description

*Spaceman* is a word-guessing game where players try to guess the **secret word** before they run out of chances. Each incorrect guess brings the **spaceman closer to being lost in space**. The player wins if they successfully guess all the letters before their chances run out.
This game was inspired by **classic word puzzle games** but with a fun **space-themed twist** to make it visually engaging. I chose this game because I've always loved word-guessing games since childhood, and recreating it brought a sense of nostalgia.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Play the Game Here: [Spaceman Game](https://shakieraearvin.github.io/Spaceman-Game/)

#### ðŸ›  How to Play
1. Click on a **letter** to guess if it is part of the secret word.
2. If the letter is **correct**, it will appear in the word.
3. If the letter is **incorrect**, the spaceman image will change, indicating the number of chances left.
4. You have **9 chances** to guess the correct word.
5. **Win** by completing the word before you run out of chances.
6. If you **lose**, the correct word is revealed, and you can restart the game.
